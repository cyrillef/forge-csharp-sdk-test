# Forge C# Sample App

## Overview
This sample app uses the Forge .Net (C#) SDK to introduce the 
[OAuth](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/overview/), 
[Data Management](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/overview/) 
and [Model Derivative](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/overview/) Forge APIs, 
as well as the [Viewer](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v2/overview/) JavaScript library. 
It shows the following typical workflow:

* Create a 2-legged authentication token
* Create a bucket (an arbitrary space to store objects)
* Upload a file to the bucket
* Prepare the file for displaying in the Viewer (translate the file into SVF format)
* Display the translated file in the Viewer
